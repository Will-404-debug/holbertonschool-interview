# Sandpiles

## Description
The Sandpiles project implements a simulation of the sandpile model, where two 3x3 grids of sand grains are summed, and the resulting grid is stabilized through a toppling process. A sandpile is considered stable when no cell contains more than 3 grains of sand. When a cell exceeds this threshold, it "topples," distributing grains to its neighboring cells.
